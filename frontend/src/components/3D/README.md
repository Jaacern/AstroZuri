## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**3D views not loading**
- Check WebGL support: Visit `chrome://gpu/` or similar
- Update graphics drivers
- Enable hardware acceleration in browser settings

**Poor performance**
- Close other browser tabs
- Disable browser extensions temporarily  
- Lower simulation quality in settings

**Controls not responding**
- Ensure mouse/trackpad drivers are updated
- Try different mouse sensitivity settings
- Check for JavaScript errors in browser console

### Performance Tips
- Use a dedicated GPU if available
- Close unnecessary applications
- Use fullscreen mode for best experience
- Reduce browser zoom level to 100%
