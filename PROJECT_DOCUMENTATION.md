## 🔬 Scientific Foundation

### Impact Calculation Methodology

Our simulation engine employs scientifically validated algorithms:

#### 1. Energy Calculation
```
Kinetic Energy = 0.5 × Mass × Velocity²
where:
- Mass = (4/3) × π × radius³ × density
- Velocity = asteroid velocity relative to Earth
- Density = material-specific (2600 kg/m³ for rock, 900 kg/m³ for ice)
```

#### 2. Crater Formation (USGS Scaling Laws)
```
Crater Diameter = k × Energy^0.33 × angle_correction × target_correction
where:
- k = scaling constant (0.012 for land, 0.015 for water)
- angle_correction = sin(impact_angle)^0.5
- target_correction = material-specific factor
```

#### 3. Blast Damage Assessment
- **No Survivors Zone**: 0.001 × TNT_equivalent^0.33 km
- **Heavy Damage**: 0.003 × TNT_equivalent^0.33 km  
- **Moderate Damage**: 0.01 × TNT_equivalent^0.33 km
- **Light Damage**: 0.03 × TNT_equivalent^0.33 km

#### 4. Seismic Magnitude
```
Richter Magnitude = (log₁₀(Energy) - 4.8) / 1.5
```

#### 5. Tsunami Modeling (Ocean Impacts)
```
Tsunami Height = 0.1 × TNT_equivalent^0.25 × depth_factor
```
